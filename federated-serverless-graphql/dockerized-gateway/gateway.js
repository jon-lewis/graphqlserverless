// Instead of doing the servicelist it is recommended to turn off introspection

// So, the recommended way of doing this is to use a schema registry:

// I guess that is a managed service sold by Apollo :(

// We could now put a services.json into a repo somewhere and git clone it into the docker image through the docker build process
